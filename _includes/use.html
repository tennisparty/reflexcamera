                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The system runs on a 12v battery which must be bought seperately. The system can run on any battery chemistry which gives great flexibility. Lithium-ion batteries are lighter, easier to maintain and better in colder temperatures but are more expensive. Lead acid batteries are about twice as heavy but cheaper for the equivalent capacity. 12v batteries can be linked to solar panel for additional capacity if there is sufficient sun in the setup location.

                    The system run time is dependent on the amp hours of the battery. The actual run time will be dependent on the battery temperature and night length. Some indicative run times are given below:</p>
