                    <div class="list">
                        <ul>
                            <li>a £150 3.3kg lithium ion battery + £60 charger + a £60 custom waterproof suitcase</li>
                            <li>a £100 15kg cube battery + £100 car battery charger</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>*Batteries must be bought directly from the suppliers due to shipping costs and safety documentation. Both suppliers are based in mainland Europe so I have provided estimated costs based on the euro to GBP exchange rate</p>
