                    <p>The camera costs £600.</p>
                    <plist>Batteries must be purchased separately. There are two tested options available:</plist>

                        <ul>
                            <li>a £150 3.3kg lithium ion battery + £60 charger + a £60 custom waterproof suitcase I will build</li>
                            <plist>or</plist>
                            <li>a £100 15kg cube battery + £100 car battery charger</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>**** ADD AS A STAR **** Batteries must be bought directly from the suppliers due to shipping costs and safety documentation. Both suppliers are based in mainland Europe so I have provided estimated costs based on the euro to GBP exchange rate</p>
                    <p>I make these cameras in my spare time so will need approximately a month to source parts and build the camera. Please contact me with the details provided below to enquire about the build and payment.</p>
