                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The system runs on a 12v battery. This must be bought seperately. Any chemistry is suitable so you can use lead acid and lithium ion batteries. This gives great flexibility. Lithium-ion batteries are lighter, easier to maintain and better in colder temperatures but are more expensive. The battery can be linked to a solar panel if setup in a sunny spot.
                    <br>
                    The system run time is dependent on the amp hours of the battery. Some indicative figures are given below*</p>
